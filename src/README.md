## Test Coverage

The application includes comprehensive test coverage for edge cases:

- Malformed JSON response handling
- Server error (500) handling
- Zero spots left display
- Maximum spots available display
- Special characters in activity names (XSS protection)
- Missing activity details handling

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:
   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

## Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling for:
- Invalid JSON responses
- Server errors
- Full activity registration
- Missing activity data
- Input validation
